                Baby, life was good to me
                But you just made it better
                I love the way you stand by me
                Through any kind of weatherI don't wanna run away, just wanna make your day
                When you feel the world is on your shoulders
                I don't wanna make it worse, just wanna make us work
                Baby, tell me I will do whateverIt feels like nobody ever knew me until you knew me
                Feels like nobody ever loved me until you loved me
                Feels like nobody ever touched me until you touched me
                Baby, nobody, nobody until you
                Baby, it just took one hit of you
                Now I'm addicted
                You never know what's missing
                Till you get everything you neededI don't wanna run away just wanna make your day
                When you feel the world is on your shoulders
                I don't wanna make it worse just wanna make us work
                Baby, tell me, I will do whateverIt feels like nobody ever knew me until you knew me
                Feels like nobody ever loved me until you loved me
                Feels like nobody ever touched me until you touched me
                Baby, nobody, nobody until youSee it was enough to know, if I ever let you go
                I would be no one
                'Cause I never thought I'd feel all the things you made me feel
                Wasn't looking for someone, oh, until you
